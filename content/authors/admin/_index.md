I am an assistant professor of Finance at ESCP Business School in the Madrid Campus. I received my Ph.D. in Finance from the Stockholm School of Economics (SSE).

My research is primarily theoretical, focusing on asset pricing, market microstructure and household finance. I am interested in exploring how the financial decisions of retail investors and households are influenced by the information they receive, under both full and bounded rationality. 

In addition to my Ph.D., I hold a BSc in International Economics, Management and Finance from Bocconi University, and a MSc Finance from Bocconi University and MSc Finance & Investments from Rotterdam School of Management (double degree). Before joining the Ph.D. program at SSE, I worked as a trainee in DG Monetary Policy at the European Central Bank (ECB) and in DG ECFIN at the European Commission.
