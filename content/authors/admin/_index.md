I am a Ph.D. student in the Finance Department at the Stockholm School of Economics (SSE) and the Swedish House of Finance. 

My research is primarily theoretical, focusing on asset pricing, market microstructure and household finance. The questions I address also relate to information economics and behavioral finance. In my projects, I explore how the financial decisions of retail investors and households are influenced by the information they receive, under both full and bounded rationality. 

**I will be on the 2024-2025 Job Market.** [You can find my Job Market Paper here](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/bh20o5p6u21d6uiokrj87/Correlation_Neglect.pdf?rlkey=jvfduclbeyvos48pekwm3vzp4&st=noak5alv&dl=0)

I hold a BSc in International Economics, Management and Finance from Bocconi University, and a MSc Finance from Bocconi University and MSc Finance & Investments from Rotterdam School of Management (double degree). Before joining the Ph.D. program at SSE, I worked as a trainee in DG Monetary Policy at the European Central Bank (ECB) and in DG ECFIN at the European Commission.
